<h1>Java Projects</h1>
<p>It's nice to have the projects in a runable jar file and accept arguments from the command line, but inspecting the code and learning from the code is what I find to be most important. To get one of my projects working on your own machine with Java installed and looking through the code in an IDE to learn from is really easy if you know already how to import existing projects into workspaces. No maven needed.</p>
<h2>How to install a Java project in this repository:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Pick an IDE to use for inspecting Java code. I'll use Eclipse for this example, it should be similar in most other IDE's.</li>
  <li>Download the zip folder of the project you wish to inspect the code, or clone the repository for all projects.</li>
  <li>Unzip the project you downloaded and make sure it resides in a folder to its own with a similar name as the zip file.</li>
  <li>Start your IDE. When you have everything installed and running, make sure you're able to view a Package explorer, or Project Explorer, or some tab that has a list of all the projects in that workspace.</li>
  <li>Import an Existing project into the workspace.</li>
  <li>Browse through all the files of the project and start opening classes.</li>
  <li>The main method is most likely located in a class labeled as (project_name)App, or (project_name)Launcher as per my convention of naming.</li>
  <li>You might run into issues such as "Missing Libraries" or needing some libraries to be imported. This can easily be fixed with looking in the "lib" folder in the base folder of the project.</li>
